                    Our boarding service is one of a kind. Your dog will be taken care of the same way it would be in your house.
                    Your dog will be taken out outside to our spacious fully fenced backyard, every 2-3 hours to play with other dogs, or just to hang out in fresh air.
                    In case your doggy needs to go outside more often, he/she will be offered extra time outside with no additional cost,
                    which you will not be offered in a different place for free. Your poochie will also be provided with a bed/blanket and food&water bowls.
                    So, please do NOT bring anything else other than his/her food.
                    We require that your dog is up-to-date on his vaccines (please check with your dogâ€™s vet about the vaccines needed for boarding & daycare).
                    Your dog will sleep in a crate at night. So, we also require that he/she is Crate-trained. In case you want your dog to be taken outside alone (One-on-One Care),
                    there will be an extra charge of $5 per night.
